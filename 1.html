    The first paper on <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning"
    target = "_blank" title="Zero-shot_learning">zero-shot learning</a> 
   
    in natural language processing appeared in AAAIâ€™08, but the name given to the learning paradigm there was dataless classification.[2] The first paper on zero-shot learning in computer vision appeared at the same conference, under the name zero-data learning.[3] 
    This direction was popularized later in another, more well-known, CV paper[4] and the term zero-shot learning caught up, paraphrasing on one-shot learning that was introduced in computer vision years earlier.[5]
    </p><p>In computer vision, zero-shot learning models learned parameters for seen classes along with their class representations and rely on representational similarity among class labels so that, during inference, instances can be classified into new classes.
